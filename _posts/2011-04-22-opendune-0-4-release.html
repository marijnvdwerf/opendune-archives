                    <p>Today we are proud to announce the release of OpenDUNE 0.4</p>
<p>This is the third release in a set of releases which concentrate in  understanding and rewriting all functions of the original code, making  enhancements on the way, without really changing the game in any way. A  complete list of enhancements can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703035628/http://svn.opendune.org/tags/0.4/enhancement.txt?mode=view#filecontent">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release is heavily delayed as development slowed down a bit, and because we didn’t feel it release worthy till now. This version is much more stable, and it has been a long time ago that we have seen crashes like earlier releases did.</p>
<p>As per usual, a changelog has been made, and can be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703035628/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.4/changelog.txt">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.4/changelog.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that until we can convert more of the game, you   still need to manually put the Dune2 data files in the proper directory;   if you do not, the game will not start.</p>
<p>You can download the release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703035628/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.4/">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.4/</a>,  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703035628/http://forum.opendune.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=135">here</a> you can discuss the release on our forum.</p>
