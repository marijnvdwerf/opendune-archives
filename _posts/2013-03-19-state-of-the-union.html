                    <p>This is mostly meant for</p>
<p>@wangds<br>
@miniupnp</p>
<p>I just added both of you to the “allowed to commit” list.</p>
<p>Basically, the last few weeks have clearly shown I don’t have the time to manage this project anymore. You both are very capable and have shown to understand the principles of the project. Above that, the commit style and code style of the patches you provide is exactly what I would like to see. Therefor, I gave you both access. I hope this speeds up development a bit, and stabilizes the codebase faster.</p>
<p>If you want to decline the invite; no harm done. Don’t feel obligated <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703060823im_/http://www.opendune.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"><br>
I do would like to ask you to maintain a few key principals of OpenDUNE. I know many will speak for itself, but I still like to write them down <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703060823im_/http://www.opendune.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley">  It will also be posted on GitHub ( https://github.com/OpenDUNE/OpenDUNE/issues/197 ) and forum, so everyone knows what it going on.</p>
<p>- Stick to Dune2. If you really want to add new features like multi-unit select etc, please do make a fork and do it there. Keep OpenDUNE as close as you can to Dune2. I would very much appreciate that.</p>
<p>- Keep the code as much as you can close to Ansi-C. Don’t go all out with C++, templates, and all that shit. It is nice and all, but the niceness of OpenDUNE is in its simplicity.</p>
<p>- Don’t commit code to the master that is not finished, or violates coding style. Make a branch, make a fork .. Github is your friend.</p>
<p>- If you can add compatibility to the modpacks out there, that would be lovely. But, please keep the original Dune2 in there.</p>
<p>- Please keep in mind not everyone uses SDL, so keep stuff like Windows GDI. If you add another video or sound driver, awesome. Please don’t make other drivers obsolete. People like to pick what they fancy most. Don’t take that away from them.</p>
<p>- Be strict. Many people will send crappy patches, and claim it is the world. Many will ask for small favors, because it is awesome. Respect the project; don’t accept patches that are not worth accepting.</p>
<p>I will of course be around for questions, proof-reading of patches, and the normal nagging about coding-style and direction of the game. Always available on IRC, irc.oftc.net, #opendune.</p>
