                    <p>As of now, we moved our Version Control System (VCS) from SVN to Git, and moved it to github. This should make it easier for others to make changes (read: fork), and send us patches (read: Push Requests), which we than can apply faster/easier.</p>
<p>It also means we will remove our Mantis bugtracker, as the github issue tracker is easier and more open. We will also remove our wiki, as it is only used for spam anyway.</p>
<p>Forum will remain open for now; but it has to be reviewed if that is the best way. Please debate about this on the forum (the irony!).</p>
