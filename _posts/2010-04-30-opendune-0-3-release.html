                    <p>Today we are proud to announce the release of OpenDUNE 0.3</p>
<p>This is the second release in a set of releases which concentrate in understanding and rewriting all functions of the original code, making enhancements on the way, without really changing the game in any way. A complete list of enhancements can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703043442/http://svn.opendune.org/tags/0.3/enhancement.txt?mode=view#filecontent">here</a>.</p>
<p>As per usual, a changelog has been made, and can be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703043442/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.3/changelog.txt">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.3/changelog.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that until we can convert more of the game, you  still need to manually put the Dune2 data files in the proper directory;  if you do not, the game will not start.</p>
<p>You can download the release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703043442/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.3/">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.3/</a>,  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703043442/http://forum.opendune.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=56">here</a> you can discuss the release on our forum.</p>
