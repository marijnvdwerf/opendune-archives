                    <p>Today we are proud to announce the release of OpenDUNE 0.2</p>
<p>This will be the first release featuring our re-doing of the original code, as such, several ‘enhancements’ have been made, enhancements which we find will improve the game, without changing the feel of the game. A complete list can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703045421/http://svn.opendune.org/tags/0.2/enhancement.txt?mode=view#filecontent">here</a>.</p>
<p>As per usual, a changelog has been made, and can be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703045421/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.2/changelog.txt">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.2/changelog.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that until we can convert more of the game, you still need to manually put the Dune2 data files in the proper directory; if you do not, the game will not start.</p>
<p>You can download the release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703045421/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.2/">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.2/</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703045421/http://forum.opendune.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=38">here</a> you can discuss the release on our forum.</p>
