                    <p>Today we present you our latest version of OpenDUNE: version 0.7.</p>
<p>This release comes with a new configure system (with a big hug to OpenTTD), a native video driver for Windows, better sound support for Windows (natively) and Linux (fully via ALSA), many fixes, naming of functions and variables, support for Windows 64bit, and many more. Short: it should be a lot more stable.</p>
