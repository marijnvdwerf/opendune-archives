                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>As of yesterday we are proud to anounce the following:</p>
<p>The release of the second Pre-Alpha teaser, this time WITH support for Windows</p>
<p>With the help of glx, the team managed to get the current codebase to compile and run on windows.. while this is far from a completed product (the pre-alpha should have given that bit away, really), this is a major step towards functional code.</p>
<p>The link to said release can be found on the forum ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708075058/http://forum.opendune.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=9" target="_self">here</a> )</p>
<p>This new development should also open things up for people to help; if you think you can help us with the project, feel free to drop us a line through mail or on irc (#openDUNE on oftc).</p>
<p><strong> What’s up ahead?</strong></p>
<p>With this hurdle out of the way we can now focus on the code, with some brilliant help from nsz we managed to increase our database of decompiled parts by miles, but there’s still much work to be done.</p>
<p>As it stands, most of the code is still in a semi-ASM-like state, where simple things like loops are scattered across dozens of functions.. our task now is to tackle all that, and turn the (for now) ugly code into neat, runnable (and fully functioning) code, to bring us closer to the first Alpha build.</p>
<p>Now to not get people’s hopes up for nothing, this task will take a long time, think of it as a huge 3d jigsaw puzzle.. only one that’s mostly black with some markings here or there… and around 10000 pieces of them.</p>
<p>As I said above as well, if you feel like you’re up for the challenge, every and any use will be greatly appreciated.. you don’t need to know ASM for this, though some C knowledge helps a great deal in figuring out.</p>
<p><strong>Wait, there’s more?!?</strong></p>
<p>Correct!</p>
<p>We decided to abort our idea of using Redmine .. as it’s proven itself more than unstable with a repository the size of what we already created (and there will be more), frequently crashing itself after eating up every single byte of spare memory (including swap).. Instead we have swapped to two new systems:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708075058/http://bugs.opendune.org/" target="_self">bugs.OpenDUNE.org</a></p>
<p>Using the Mantis bug tracking system, this will be where we will deal with issues that may arise in the future.. for now it’ll stay quite calm as we don’t have a (semi)stable product just yet..</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708075058/http://svn.opendune.org/" target="_self">svn.OpenDUNE.org</a></p>
<p>A slightly customized installation of WebSVN, this will show you the changelog of the repository, and allow you to browse our code from a browser.. ofcourse we also have a proper svn implementation for your favourite svn client, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708075058/svn://svn.opendune.org/">svn://svn.opendune.org/</a></p>
<p>Time to wrap this up</p>
<p>Seeing I personally dislike walls of dea^h^h^h text, I’ll keep this simple with the message that the public front page ( http://www.opendune.org ) might be taken down at some point to be replaced with functioning code.. this shouldn’t take long, but you might experience some interruptions.</p>
<p>- The Team</p>
