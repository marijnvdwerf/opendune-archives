                    <p>Today we are proud to announce the release of OpenDUNE 0.5</p>
<p>This is the fourth release in a set of releases which concentrate in   understanding and rewriting all functions of the original code, making   enhancements on the way, without really changing the game in any way. A   complete list of enhancements can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703063328/http://svn.opendune.org/tags/0.5/enhancement.txt?mode=view#filecontent">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release finally has all functions converted to ‘real C’, and we are  now cleaning up stuff. A lot of functions have been named, variables  have been identified, and the stability has increased a lot. Many small  (and odd) bugs have been fixed and addressed.</p>
<p>A big welcome goes  to Alberth, which joined our development team for this release. He is  partly the reason we are much further along than I expected to be.</p>
<p>For the next release we will try to remove the libemu dependency, making that release the first ‘stand alone’ release.</p>
<p>As per usual, a changelog has been made, and can be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703063328/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.5/changelog.txt">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.5/changelog.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that until we understand more of the game, you    still need to manually put the Dune2 data files in the proper  directory;   if you do not, the game will not start.</p>
<p>You can download the release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703063328/http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.5/">http://binaries.opendune.org/releases/0.5/</a>,  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703063328/http://forum.opendune.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=143">here</a> you can discuss the release on our forum.</p>
